# The `onavg` (OpenNeuro Average) template

The ``onavg`` surface template was created using high-quality structural scans of 1,031 participants from 30 [OpenNeuro](https://openneuro.org/) datasets.
Different from previous surface templates, the vertex locations of ``onavg`` are optimized so that different regions of the cerebral cortex are sampled with the same resolution.

See [our manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.03.21.533686) for more details.
